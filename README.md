# Chat Robot

### Statement
The goal of Chat Robot is to create a chat robot using machine learning. It will be a single page web app where users can talk to the chat robot through a front end interface, and it can learn things about them. The most interesting aspect of Chat Robot is the machine learning. Saurabh and I are personally interested in machine learning, and would like to learn more about it.

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project.

Be explicit about the techiques from the class that you will use. For example:

- Will you use data abstraction? How?
- Will you use recursion? How?
- Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? 
- Will you use object-orientation? How?
- Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? How?
- Will you use state-modification approaches? How? (If so, this should be encapsulated within objects. `set!` pretty much should only exist inside an object.)
- Will you build an expression evaluator, like we did in the symbolic differentatior and the metacircular evaluator?
- Will you use lazy evaluation approaches?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

**Your project will be graded, in part, by the extent to which you adopt approaches from the course into your implementation, _and_ your discussion about this.**

### External Technologies
- Chat Robot will be hosted on a web-server, and published to the web.  


You are encouraged to develop a project that connects to external systems. For example, this includes systems that:

- retrieve information or publish data to the web
- generate or process sound
- control robots or other physical systems
- interact with databases

If your project will do anything in this category (not only the things listed above!), include this section and discuss.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload from a website? Access in a database? Create in a simulation you will build? ...)

How will you convert your data into a form usable for your project?  

If you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it before writing the proposal. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materials, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
At the completion of our project, we will have an interactive single page web application. During the demo, a user will be able to talk
to the chat robot, and give it some information. The robot wil be able to "learn" from this information. It will be able to recall the information when prompted, as well as have altered dialogue based on user input. When prompted by the user, the robot will be able to perform simple tasks, such as search for something on the web.

### Evaluation of Results
A number of tests will need to pass to prove we are successful. An example would be if we told the robot some information about 
ourselves, such as name, age, height, favorite foods, etc., and the robot was then able to recall that information when prompted, then
we would know we were successful.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.

#### Scott Mello @mello244688
will work on things related to the web-server libraries, such as creating the user interface. Along with Saurabh, will do research on
machine learning, and help implement machine learning algorithms.

#### Saurabh Verma @sv-uml
Saurabh will work on building out the backend for the bot. This includes setting up the database, helping the bot "learn" from available data and writing natural language processing algorithms for communication.


##### Milestone 1:
will have a prototype of the ui working, where there is an input field and text field for viewing messages.  
Along with Saurabh, will be researching machine learning, and beginning to implement algorithms.  
##### Milestone 2:
will have the user interface completed.  
Along with Saurabh, will continue working on implementing machine learning algorithms.  
##### Milestone 3:
Along with Saurabh, will finish implementing machine learning algorithms.  
will deploy the webpage, and get users to test it, as well as make necessary changes.
